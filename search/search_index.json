Debdeb's planets are a glimpse of a distant past: there's Charr, a fiery, iron-bound ancestor of Moho; Gurdamma, a cratered oasis teeming with the ingredients for life; Ovin, a superheavy wasteland with gorgeous rings; and much, much more. Want to surf on the MASSIVE low-gravity cliffs of Axod? Dive into the storms of Dorau? or perhaps witness the Cryovolcanoes of Bis? in Debdeb, you'll feel right at home!</p> <p>SYSTEM LAYOUT</p> <p>Debdeb - On the cosmic timescale, Debdeb is a baby star. 10 million years ago, a large cold cloud of gas and dust collapsed due to gravity and formed this orange dwarf star. Surrounding it is a proto-planetary disk containing the ingredients for new planets. Within this disk orbits 6 young planets, each with gripping stories to tell.</p> <ul> <li>Charr - Do you love sunbathing? Charr is your new best friend. This bombarded hunk of iron is snuggled up right next to Debdeb, glowing bright red from the heat. Despite being smaller than Kerbin, its mighty density gives it almost twice the gravity of Kerbin! There's likely an abundance of rare metals and materials here.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Ovin - A choked atmosphere, a shattered surface and gravity that will tear you to shreds. Ovin is terrifying. We don't know how a planet like it could form. Everything about it defies our understanding of terrestrial planets. Its discovery gave many scientists nightmares for weeks afterwards.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Gurdamma - Gurdamma's bombarded surface, rapid spin and large close moon are evidence of a massive collision in the recent past. This along with its size and mass means that this young planet offers a glimpse at what early Kerbin may have looked like. Tidal forces exerted on Gurdamma from its largest moon, Donk, create giant tidal waves and extreme global volcanism. The plumes from these volcanoes reach high into the atmosphere and are one of the most prominent features when the planet is viewed from space.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Donk - Donk was allowed to be named by a public vote and is now a permanent reminder to never do that again. This young moon is constantly being squeezed and stretched by Gurdamma, causing volcanism and massive tears to open in the crust, giving us a view into the mantle. It resembles our own Mun in many ways; maria, dense crater fields, same gray color, etc. Donk has a temporary atmosphere that is getting blown into space by the solar wind.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li> <p>Kevba's Anomaly - A wormhole that connects the Kerbolar system with the Debdeb system. Orbits Gurdamma. Its other side is located in Dres orbit. (Only existing via enabling wormholes.) (No image provided for Wormholes)</p> </li> <li> <p>Gup - This little nugget was flung into a far elliptical orbit, likely after the recent collision that formed Donk. It spins very fast which has flattened it into a disk shape. Landing around the equator is extremely difficult thanks to this spin. </p> </li> <li> <p>Lapat - Lapat's thick carbon dioxide wraps it in an eerie shroud. Through the smog, we can just about make out dots of foamy water amongst dunes of white sand. Lapat's most striking features are its great mesas that climb high into the sky, escaping the soupy environment around their bases. If you fancy a hot summer day then Lapat is the place! Unless you also fancy suffocating and being crushed like a can..... Pluses and minuses.</p> </li> </ul> <p>(No image as Lapat is still WIP)</p> <ul> <li>Axod - The skewed dwarf planet Axod spins so fast that its hemispheres have offset over time, giving it a unique shape and creating the highest cliffs Kerbalkind has ever seen. We're hoping to transport Kerbin's most extreme sports personalities here to perform some insane stunts with Axod's thin ring system and small moon, Umod, in the background.</li> </ul> <p>(No image as Axod is still WIP)</p> <ul> <li>Umod - Umod bears many battle scars. This shattered moon of Axod is putting itself back together after a violent past. While its divets and folds don't hold a flame to its parent body, the swirling patterns and coloration make it stand out. It's oddly delicious looking...</li> </ul> <p>(No image as Umod is still WIP)</p> <ul> <li>Dorau - The mystical Dorau lurks amongst the dark clouds of the outer Debdeb system. This ice giant has lots of methane in its atmosphere, turning it sea blue. Supersonic wind speeds create the drama here, with large storms around the equator, seeded by impact events after the capturing of Bis sent its former moons into chaos. If you have a good eye, you might spot its faint rings.</li> </ul> <p>(No image as Dorau is still WIP)</p> <ul> <li>Bis - This ball of ice was named for its crinkly cantaloupe terrain and canyons resembling a crunchy ice biscuit. The crust, made of ammonia, water, and nitrogen ice, conceals the liquid ocean beneath. This ocean causes extreme cryovolcanism leading to eruptions and crimson stains across the surface, especially inside of the canyons. Large impacts have formed flat planitia around the place, reminding you of Minmus. It also has a thin atmosphere.</li> </ul> <p>(No image as Bis is still WIP)</p> <p>The Systems of Promised Worlds may change in-between updates.

Eleven exotic worlds are anchored around a massive, F-Class star. Brave the barycenter of Rask and Rusk, navigate the depths of Puf's superocean, and dive into Verda's cloud deck in this ultimate interstellar adventure.</p> <p>SYSTEM LAYOUT</p> <ul> <li> <p>Tuun - Bigger, brighter, hotter, mass-ier, Tuun is an F-type main-sequence star, and is the brightest star in Kerbin's night sky. Its Goldilocks zone is massive, meaning this star system has more potential for life than the Kerbolar system! Maybe you'll turn over a rock and find a teeny-tiny space center.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hurr - There's nowhere as windy and as blustery as Hurr. Tidally-locked to Tuun, the side facing the sun is constantly blasted with heat, while the dark side is hidden away, forever a cold bleak landscape of snow and ice. Temperatures are much more liveable along the terminator, with some spots of liquid water. It's a great place for generating power. Wind and sun are plentiful here! Just be careful where you place your colony...</p> </li> <li> <p>Rask &amp; Rusk - You've never seen siblings fight like this! The fiery twins Rask and Rusk were born after their gargantuan parent proto-planet was split in half, leaving two planets now trapped in an endless destructive spiral. Their immense gravity and proximity means they are slowly ripping each other apart. Be careful when flying near this pair, lest you be caught in the crossfire!</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p>Rem - The warm and watery Rem is covered completely by a planet-wide ocean. Its high but comfortable gravity and a thick oxygen atmosphere makes it a good location for a colony, and its ring system and tall cloud stacks make for a stunning view. Those shallow parts are mesas that rise up to just below the water. We could build a platform above the water there, though if it doesn't work out then we'd be stuck there. Remember your life jacket!</p> </li> <li> <p>Flot - If you were to observe Flot from the seas of Rem, you would see stunning greenery divided by a vast network of hundreds of rivers, topped with fluffy water clouds. Flot's abundance of water and thick oxygen atmosphere give the right conditions for all sorts of complex life! See those big circular oceans? Those are deep water-filled impact craters. Perfect for diving!</p> </li> <li> <p>Verda - Verda is a mystery to us. Its entire surface is hidden by thick cloud coverage. Judging by this, it must have a good amount of water down there. That's all we know about it though, since we can't see anything. Verda could be made entirely from noodles and we wouldn't know until we went there. It's a warm planet and may support some noodly life.</p> </li> <li> <p>Puf - When we first observed Puf, we were shocked to see it staring right back at us. That pupil-like sea is no ordinary sea, but the deepest sea we've ever seen, eating over 100km into the ground. These depths were likely formed when an asteroid carved through Puf's low-density surface. The thin methane atmosphere and unusually low gravity makes it a relatively easy destination. We can't quite describe it, but there's something unsettling about this planet...</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Glumo - Groovy Glumo is truly one of a kind. Between the iconic rings and colorful satellites, there's no place quite as stunning. Uniquely, it rolls on its side with a 63\u00b0 axial tilt. Its gaseous outer layer, containing water, ammonia and ammonium hydrosulfide ices, interacts with the light in different ways per season, causing extreme color changes. As a result, astronomers have on numerous occasions mistaken it for a completely different planet!</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p>Noj - Noj is a shepherd moon formed from the accretion of ice and other silly things encountered while orbiting Glumo's ring system. Dust stains the ice to create lovely pops of color on it's surface. Pretty colors aside, scientists can't shut up about the initial readings from Noj, and they want more data, if we can get there.</p> </li> <li> <p>Merbel - Merbel has gone a different aesthetic direction from other celestial bodies. It dons a bold sea of methane and ammonia between its two massive ice caps. The dizzying rotation speed and low inclination gets the equator a lot of Tuun's attention. Merbel's orbital plane is completely off from Glumo's equator, suggesting it was once a planet itself that got captured by Glumo. Other moons may have been destabilized, possibly creating Glumo's iconic rings!</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Skut - Skut is the funkiest chunk of rock around! See how it looks like two asteroids fused together? Well we think that's how it got its unique arrowhead shape. Skut's shape isn't the only oddity though. Its wildly eccentric orbit sees it pass extremely close to Tuun and then back out into the farther reaches of the system. Maybe it can't decide where to set the thermostat.</li> </ul> <p>The Systems of Promised Worlds may change in-between updates.
