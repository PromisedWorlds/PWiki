Want to brave the crater lakes of Gurdamma? Launch between the molten seas of Rask and Rusk? Our team of veteran KSP 1 modders is working around the globe to bring you those experiences\u2014and more!</p> <p>So far, we have implemented the Debdeb System. The Tuun System is in the early stages of development, with a few planets implemented in development builds. The Qeg System is being conceptualized (an uncertain feature).</p> <p>All content for Promised Worlds is being designed in-house. We are not using any KSP 2 assets. </p> <p>Each world has been meticulously crafted to align with KSP 2 development screenshots and data mining discoveries. For celestial bodies lacking implementation details (e.g., Umod), we are applying creative liberties to attain what we feel were the KSP 2 developers' intentions.</p> <p>Promised Worlds is currently in early access. Planets, moons, and other features are being added incrementally in updates. We're nearing a full release now with only a handful of features left to add. </p> <p>If you want to stay up to date with progress or contribute, join our Discord server!</p> <p>The Systems of Promised Worlds may change in-between updates. Please notify the Dev team if this is out of date, or make an issue on this repository.</p> <p>The Wiki of PW is currently for PW version 2.0.0 (Not released.), If you still see this message upon the release of 2.0.0, please notify the Dev team, or report an issue</p>"}]}
