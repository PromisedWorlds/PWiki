# Skut

Skut is the funkiest chunk of rock around! See how it looks like two asteroids fused together? Well we think that's how it got its unique arrowhead shape. Skut's shape isn't the only oddity though. Its wildly eccentric orbit sees it pass extremely close to Tuun and then back out into the farther reaches of the system. Maybe it can't decide where to set the thermostat.
