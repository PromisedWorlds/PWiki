# Verda

Verda is a mystery to us. Its entire surface is hidden by thick cloud coverage. Judging by this, it must have a good amount of water down there. That's all we know about it though, since we can't see anything. Verda could be made entirely from noodles and we wouldn't know until we went there. It's a warm planet and may support some noodly life.
