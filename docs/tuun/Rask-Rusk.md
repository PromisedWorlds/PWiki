# Rask & Rusk

You've never seen siblings fight like this! The fiery twins Rask and Rusk were born after their gargantuan parent proto-planet was split in half, leaving two planets now trapped in an endless destructive spiral. Their immense gravity and proximity means they are slowly ripping each other apart. Be careful when flying near this pair, lest you be caught in the crossfire!
