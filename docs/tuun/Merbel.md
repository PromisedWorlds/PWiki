# Merbel

![](../assets/Merbel.png)

Merbel has gone a different aesthetic direction from other celestial bodies. It dons a bold sea of methane and ammonia between its two massive ice caps. The dizzying rotation speed and low inclination gets the equator a lot of Tuun's attention. Merbel's orbital plane is completely off from Glumo's equator, suggesting it was once a planet itself that got captured by Glumo. Other moons may have been destabilized, possibly creating Glumo's iconic rings!
