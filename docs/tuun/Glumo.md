# Glumo

Groovy Glumo is truly one of a kind. Between the iconic rings and colorful satellites, there's no place quite as stunning. Uniquely, it rolls on its side with a 63° axial tilt. Its gaseous outer layer, containing water, ammonia and ammonium hydrosulfide ices, interacts with the light in different ways per season, causing extreme color changes. As a result, astronomers have on numerous occasions mistaken it for a completely different planet!
