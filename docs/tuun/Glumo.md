# Glumo

Groovy Glumo is truly one of a kind. Between the iconic rings and colorful satellites, there's no place quite as stunning. Uniquely, it rolls on its side with a 63° axial tilt. Its gaseous outer layer, containing water, ammonia and ammonium hydrosulfide ices, interacts with the light in different ways per season, causing extreme color changes. As a result, astronomers have on numerous occasions mistaken it for a completely different planet!

## Detailed Explanation of Glumo:

Glumo Frequents a still, calm, but very interesting gaseous state. It's been the only observed Gas Giant to Kerbals to have seasonal weather changes. That also includes some swaying colors as mentioned above. Aurora are also a frequent occurence on Glumo and it's moons. Meaning, you may not see them all the time.
