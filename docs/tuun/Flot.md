# Flot

If you were to observe Flot from the seas of Rem, you would see stunning greenery divided by a vast network of hundreds of rivers, topped with fluffy water clouds. Flot's abundance of water and thick oxygen atmosphere give the right conditions for all sorts of complex life! See those big circular oceans? Those are deep water-filled impact craters. Perfect for diving!
