# Puf

![](../assets/Puf.png)

When we first observed Puf, we were shocked to see it staring right back at us. That pupil-like sea is no ordinary sea, but the deepest sea we've ever seen, eating over 100km into the ground. These depths were likely formed when an asteroid carved through Puf's low-density surface. The thin methane atmosphere and unusually low gravity makes it a relatively easy destination. We can't quite describe it, but there's something unsettling about this planet...

## Detailed Explanation of Puf:

Puf's unsettling nature is due to it's extremely deep ocean, nearing 100km deep, as well as it's extremely low density, resulting in a Gravity (at sea level) of 0.22G's. It also features stunning cliffs near it's eyeball ocean, and a very thin atmosphere.
