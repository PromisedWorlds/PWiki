# Rem

The warm and watery Rem is covered completely by a planet-wide ocean. Its high but comfortable gravity and a thick oxygen atmosphere makes it a good location for a colony, and its ring system and tall cloud stacks make for a stunning view. Those shallow parts are mesas that rise up to just below the water. We could build a platform above the water there, though if it doesn't work out then we'd be stuck there. Remember your life jacket!
