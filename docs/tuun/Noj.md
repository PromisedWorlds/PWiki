# Noj

Noj is a shepherd moon formed from the accretion of ice and other silly things encountered while orbiting Glumo's ring system. Dust stains the ice to create lovely pops of color on it's surface. Pretty colors aside, scientists can't shut up about the initial readings from Noj, and they want more data, if we can get there.
