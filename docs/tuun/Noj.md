# Noj

![](../assets/Noj.png)

Noj is a shepherd moon formed from the accretion of ice and other silly things encountered while orbiting Glumo's ring system. Dust stains the ice to create lovely pops of color on it's surface. Pretty colors aside, scientists can't shut up about the initial readings from Noj, and they want more data, if we can get there.

## Detailed Explanation of Noj

Noj is quite the spectacle. Due to many bombardments of it's formation, it has since been a bit lopsided. Besides that, It's worth a visit for its extremely low gravity and the dazzling views of Glumo.
