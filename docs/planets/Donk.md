# Donk

![](../assets/Donk.png)

Donk was allowed to be named by a public vote and is now a permanent reminder to never do that again. This young moon is constantly being squeezed and stretched by Gurdamma, causing volcanism and massive tears to open in the crust, giving us a view into the mantle. It resembles our own Mun in many ways; maria, dense crater fields, same gray color, etc. Donk has a temporary atmosphere that is getting blown into space by the solar wind.
