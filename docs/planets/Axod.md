# Axod

The skewed Axod spins so fast that its hemispheres have offset, creating the highest cliffs Kerbalkind has ever seen. It isn't big enough to clear a path through the protoplanetary disk, so we call it a dwarf planet. It still tries to grab debris from the disk and has decorated itself with some fancy rings.

(No image as Axod is still WIP)
