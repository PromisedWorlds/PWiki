# Charr

![](../assets/Charr.png)

Do you love sunbathing? Charr is your new best friend. This bombarded hunk of iron is snuggled up right next to Debdeb, glowing bright red from the heat. Despite being smaller than Kerbin, its mighty density gives it almost twice the gravity of Kerbin! There's likely an abundance of rare metals and materials here.
