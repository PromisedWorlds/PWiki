# Lapat

Lapat's thick carbon dioxide wraps it in an eerie shroud. Through the smog, we can just about make out dots of foamy water amongst dunes of white sand. Lapat's most striking features are its great mesas that climb high into the sky, escaping the soupy environment around their bases. If you fancy a hot summer day then Lapat is the place! Unless you also fancy suffocating and being crushed like a can..... Pluses and minuses.

(No image as Lapat is still WIP)
