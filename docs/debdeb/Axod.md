# Axod

The skewed dwarf planet Axod spins so fast that its hemispheres have offset over time, giving it a unique shape and creating the highest cliffs Kerbalkind has ever seen. We're hoping to transport Kerbin's most extreme sports personalities here to perform some insane stunts with Axod's thin ring system and small moon, Umod, in the background.

(No image as Axod is still WIP)
