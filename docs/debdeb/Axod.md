The skewed dwarf planet Axod spins so fast that its hemispheres have offset over time, giving it a unique shape and creating the highest cliffs Kerbalkind has ever seen. We're hoping to transport Kerbin's most extreme sports personalities here to perform some insane stunts with Axod's thin ring system and small moon, Umod, in the background.

## A look at Axod Close-up:

Axod is Quite the place! Because the dwarf planet spins so rapidly, once every 80 minutes, the planet has begun to fling itself apart, creating cliffs so tall it looks comical!
