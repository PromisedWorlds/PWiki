# Donk

![](../assets/Donk.png)

Donk was allowed to be named by a public vote and is now a permanent reminder to never do that again. This young moon is constantly being squeezed and stretched by Gurdamma, causing volcanism and massive tears to open in the crust, giving us a view into the mantle. It resembles our own Mun in many ways; maria, dense crater fields, same gray color, etc. Donk has a temporary atmosphere that is getting blown into space by the solar wind.

## A look at Donk Close-up:

Donk is the subject of recent formation and extreme tidal forces from Gurdamma. Scientists are allowed a good look at it's core because of it's massive lava ocean. We'd however rather call it 'Dava Ocean' according to a second naming competition, which didn't end up going well. We'd rather dismiss that claim, and just call it Donk's Ocean.

Donk also features an extremely thin atmosphere, with barely any pressure. Flying a glider on a Mun-like object? Say no more!

## General Tips for Donk
This is really just the Mun but easier. The other challenge is getting there since it's so far away. Visiting the lava oceans gives quite a sight!
