# Dorau

The mystical Dorau lurks amongst the dark clouds of the outer Debdeb system. Thin rings cut through the sky, colored by super-compressed methane ice. Methane is also abundant in the atmosphere and gives this ice giant its spectacular blue and cyan stripes. It's a greedy planet and has snatched the dwarf planet Bis from the outer system.
