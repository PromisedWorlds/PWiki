# Bis

This ball of ice was named for its crinkly cantaloupe terrain and canyons resembling a crunchy ice biscuit. The crust, made of ammonia, water, and nitrogen ice, conceals the liquid ocean beneath. This ocean causes extreme cryovolcanism leading to eruptions and crimson stains across the surface, especially inside of the canyons. Large impacts have formed flat planitia around the place, reminding you of Minmus. It also has a thin atmosphere.
