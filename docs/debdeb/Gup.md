# Gup

This little nugget was flung into a far elliptical orbit, likely after the recent collision that formed Donk. It spins very fast which has flattened it into a disk shape. Landing around the equator is extremely difficult thanks to this spin.

## Detailed Explanation of Gup:

Gup is a little tiny Oblate Moon of Gurdamma. It orbits very far out, and is quite the spectacle, that is if you're on Gup itself.

Gup's poles are quite interesting, with lots of moutains, however, don't expect to ski on them. You're more than likely to just float off into the dust of the Protoplanetary Disk.
