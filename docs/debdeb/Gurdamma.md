# Gurdamma

![](../assets/Gurdamma.png)

Gurdamma's bombarded surface, rapid spin and large close moon are evidence of a massive collision in the recent past. This along with its size and mass means that this young planet offers a glimpse at what early Kerbin may have looked like. Tidal forces exerted on Gurdamma from its largest moon, Donk, create giant tidal waves and extreme global volcanism. The plumes from these volcanoes reach high into the atmosphere and are one of the most prominent features when the planet is viewed from space.
