This repository contains the official documentation and wiki for **Promised Worlds**, a faithful revival of the solar systems Intercept Games planned to release for KSP 2.

The wiki is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme, and is hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

## About Promised Worlds

Promised Worlds brings the planned KSP 2 star systems to Kerbal Space Program 1. Our team of veteran KSP 1 modders is working around the globe to recreate these experiences with:

- **Debdeb System** - Fully implemented
- **Tuun System** - In early development
- **Qeg System** - Being conceptualized (uncertain feature)

All content is designed in-house without using any KSP 2 assets. Each world has been meticulously crafted to align with KSP 2 development screenshots and data mining discoveries.

*The Systems of Promised Worlds may change in-between updates. Please notify the Dev team if this is out of date, or make an issue on this repository.*
